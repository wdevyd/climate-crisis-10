        <h2>Trees Absorb CO₂</h2>
        <p>Trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere. 
          Through the process of photosynthesis, trees take in CO₂ and <span class="important-text">convert it into oxygen and biomass</span>, helping to reduce the overall concentration of greenhouse gases.
          Forests act as natural carbon sinks, mitigating the effects of climate change by storing large amounts of carbon in their leaves, trunks, and roots.
          In a typical year, forests absorb roughly <span class = "important-text">30%</span> of the carbon emissions produced by human activities such as burning fossil fuels. </p>

        <h2>Fact 2: Loss of Biodiversity</h2>
        <p>Deforestation leads to a significant loss of biodiversity as countless plant and animal species lose their natural habitats. 
          Forests are home to more than <span class="important-text">80%</span> of terrestrial species, providing essential ecosystems that support complex food webs and ecological processes.
          When trees are cut down, these species face <span class="important-text">displacement, reduced populations, and increased risk of extinction.</span>
          The loss of biodiversity not only threatens wildlife but also disrupts ecosystem services vital to human well-being, such as pollination, water purification, and climate regulation. </p>
