        <h2>Trees Absorb CO₂</h2>
        <p>Trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere. 
          Through the process of photosynthesis, trees take in CO₂ and <span class="important-text">convert it into oxygen and biomass</span>, helping to reduce the overall concentration of greenhouse gases.
          Forests act as natural carbon sinks, mitigating the effects of climate change by storing large amounts of carbon in their leaves, trunks, and roots.
          In a typical year, forests absorb roughly <span class="important-text">30%</span> of the carbon emissions produced by human activities such as burning fossil fuels. </p>

        <h2>Loss of Biodiversity</h2>
        <p>Deforestation leads to a significant loss of biodiversity as countless plant and animal species lose their natural habitats. 
          Forests are home to more than <span class="important-text">80%</span> of terrestrial species, providing essential ecosystems that support complex food webs and ecological processes.
          When trees are cut down, these species face <span class="important-text">displacement, reduced populations, and increased risk of extinction.</span>
          The loss of biodiversity not only threatens wildlife but also disrupts ecosystem services vital to human well-being, such as pollination, water purification, and climate regulation. </p>

        <h2>Disruption of Climate Regulation</h2>
        <p>Deforestation disrupts climate regulation by eliminating one of the planet's most effective natural systems for stabilizing temperatures and weather patterns.
          Forests act as global climate moderators by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing moisture, which helps control rainfall and cools the atmosphere.
          When forests are cleared or degraded, not only is their carbon storage capacity lost, but the local and global climate becomes more unstable, leading to <span class="important-text">higher temperatures</span>,
          changes in rainfall, more frequent <span class="important-text">droughts</span>, and stronger <span class ="important-text">storms.</span></p>

        <h2>Soil Erosion and Degradation</h2>
        <p>Soil erosion and degradation caused by deforestation strip away the fertile topsoil, essential for growing crops and sustaining ecosystems.
         Without tree roots to hold the soil in place, <span class="important-text">heavy rains</span> and winds wash or blow it away, 
         leading to <span class="important-text">barren land</span>, <span class="important-text">increased flooding</span>, and <span class="important-text">reduced agricultural productivity. </span>This loss of soil health compromises food security,
         damages local economies, and intensifies environmental problems like drought and desertification.</p>

        <h2>Water Cycle Disruption</h2>
        <p>Deforestation severely disrupts the water cycle by reducing the amount of water released into the atmosphere through transpiration.
          Trees play a vital role in maintaining <span class="important-text">regional humidity </span>and<span class="important-text"> rainfall patterns</span> by releasing water vapor from their leaves.
          When forests are cleared, this natural moisture release diminishes, leading to decreased rainfall, increased <span class="important-text">drought risks</span>, and altered weather patterns. </p>
